                <h2>About Indie AGI</h2>
                    <p>In our world of accelerating AI development, Large Language Model (LLM) application development is revolutionizing how we do business, build products, and interact with technology.</p>
                    <p>Speaking to many of you in the community, we heard your calls for real-world skills, industry insight, and a robust network of peers.</p>
                    <p>We've also heard excitement about new opportunities and apprehension about economic disruption.</p>
                    <p>So, we have created a grassroots community of supportive peers to begin Vancouver's next industrial revolution on the terms the community desires. We will be humble, we will be sensitive, and we will put the advancement of our local community first.</p>

                <h2>Workshop Abstract</h2>
                    <p>In this two-hour workshop, we will demystify the field of LLM Product Engineering through real-world design and implementation workflows.</p>
                    <p>We will be hands-on-keyboard with live workshopping & discussion the entire session. There will be no slideshow, this is not a lecture.</p>
                    <p>After the workshop, join us for our networking session at The Cider House. Use this time to engage with your peers; whether you need experience, a job, a business solution, or support to build your AI product, we will do our best to facilitate connections to help you on your path.</p>
                    <p>All skill levels are welcome. Introductory Python skills are helpful, but anyone with ambition can complete the workshop. Pair programming is encouraged.</p>
                    <p>The tech stack will be Python 3, Colab, Falcon 7-B, Hugging Face, and Streamlit.</p>
